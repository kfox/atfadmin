# Player Permissions

There are four player permission levels within atfadmin:

- Regular (lowest rank)
- Privileged (cannot be kicked by Regular players)
- Admins (manage the server)
- SuperAdmins (highest rank)

If you do not outrank another player, you cannot kick them or bring other votes against them (e.g., global mute). The only exception to this rule is that Regular players can always bring votes against other Regular players.

Admins may add or remove players to/from the Privileged Players list.

SuperAdmins can generally do anything via chat commands regardless of admin permission settings or server configuration.
