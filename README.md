# atfadmin
An admin mod for Tribes Next

## About

a tiny fishie's Admin Mod (atfadmin) for Tribes Next is a set of modified Tribes
Next server functions to help manage Tribes Next games for admins and players. There is no
client-side code within atfadmin. atfadmin is designed to be run as an add-on
to other mods to help control your server's behavior.

atfadmin originally supported Tribes 2, and was based on code from another Tribes admin mod, bwadmin.

Suggestions and contributions welcomed!
